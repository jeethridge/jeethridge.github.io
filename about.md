  Hey there! My Name is James Ethridge. I love embedded design, developing M2M
  IoTs applications, and synthesizers!
</p>

A lot of my personal work goes into developing products for the Eurorack
synth module manufacturer, [Rabid Elephant](http://www.rabidelephant.com).

In the past I developed and tested the production code for [MidiBrains](http://www.rabidelephant.com/products/midibrains/index.html).


I'm currently working on a midi-enabled voltage controlled sequential switch
called the [Sololoquy](http://www.rabidelephant.com).

I've also become interesting in developing more re-usable and robust embedded
design patters, which I'll be sharing on [GitHub](https://github.com/poole).

Thanks for reading!
