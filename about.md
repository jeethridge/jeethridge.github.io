  Hello, my name is James Ethridge. I enjoy embedded design, working with Machine to Machine (M2M)
  communications, developing IoTs applications and designing software for music electronics.
  Perhaps one day soon I'll find a way to combine all of those interests into something special ;)
</p>

*Since most of the IoTs work I'm currently doing is for a private employer,
I won't be discussing much on that topic here just this moment.*

A lot of my personal work goes into developing products for an emerging music electronics
and synthesizer manufacturer called [Rabid Elephant](http://www.rabidelephant.com).

In the past, I developed and tested the production code for [MidiBrains](http://www.rabidelephant.com/products/midibrains/index.html).

Currently, I'm working on a midi-enabled voltage controlled sequential switch
called the [Sololoquy](http://www.rabidelephant.com).

I've also become interested in developing more re-usable and robust embedded
design patterns, which I'll be sharing on [GitHub](https://github.com/jeethridge).


Thanks for reading!

It's an immensely useful tool and one I encourage you to try.
