<p class="message">
  Hi, I'm James. I'm a software engineer and a music geek. I develop software
  for embedded applications, distributed systems, and electronic music products.
  As a developer I frequently work on embedded platforms for distributed systems,
  signal processing and controls applications. As an engineer, I enjoy engaging
  in the product development process and implementing strategies for moving from
  prototype to production. In particular, I'm interested in finding ways that
  TDD, CI, and Agile methodologies can be used to improve the quality of embedded
  products and the productivity of cross disciplinary engineering teams.

Over the past three years I've designed and implemented mission-critical software
for distributed energy harvesting and power conversion systems in the renewable
energy sector. A significant amount of the work I've in this field has involved
developing embedded applications around messaging oriented middleware. I've worked
on libraries and applications that run on bare-metal, RTOS, and embedded linux
platforms. In the latter case, I maintained a set of C++ libraries
which provided LabVIEW bindings to middleware on the CompactRIO platform.
I've also prototyped a monitoring application that records data published
by various embedded systems to a time-series database or caches to Redis.

In my free time, I collaborate to develop products with some long-time friends
and colleague under the [Rabid Elephant](http://www.rabidelephant.com) trade name.

[MidiBrains](http://www.rabidelephant.com/products/midibrains/index.html) is a
DIY MIDI retrofit kit for stomp-boxes. It includes a lightweight MIDI
implementation, a slick UI consisting of one button and one LED, and
a nice small form-factor pcb/insert that fits in a 9v battery cradle.
Unfortunately, the retrofit proved a bit too difficult for this to gain any real momentum.
We found even guitar techs needed considerably more support than we anticipated.
Still, it was the first product we did and it has a special place in my heart.
In addition to our own basements, they're still floating around out there with
a handful of professional musicians from NJ to Costa Rica. I'm particularly
proud that we've never had any software bug reports or failures in
the 5 years they've been in the wild. Software acceptance testing for this product
was semi-automated and took about 3 days to complete.

The [Sololoquy](http://www.rabidelephant.com/products/sololoquy/index.html) is a
voltage controlled sequential switch intended to provide a solution for on the
fly patch routing and sequencing in Eurorack format modular synthesizers.
It's got a rich feature set and highly playable user interface, making it suitable
for both automation and live performance. In tandem with Sololoquy, I'm working
on a python utility for updating firmware via MIDI which will be featured
on several other products in the line.
